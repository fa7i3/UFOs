# UFOs
# Overview.
The purpose of this project is to build a unique table using data stored in JavaScript array and a webpage that shows UFOs sightings observations. Due to how much data we have, adding filters to the table makes it easier for users to refine their search, and place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

# Resources.
* Datasets:
    1) data.js
* Software:
    1) JavaScript
    2) HTML
    3) CSS
    4) Bootstrap
    5) D3 library
 
 # Results.
 The result was the working website that filtered the data using five diffrent categories which are: date, city, state, country and shape.

* The unique website shows the UFO's sightings data in a well structured table which details the date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments;
* The website was designed using HTML and JavaScript; arranged and decorated using CSS and Bootstrap;
*  To navigate through the website, the user needs to click on the different boxes provided on the left side and type a text in each box (category) to be filtered;
*  Clicking on the top left of the webpage where it says UFO Sightings returns it to the orginal dataset.

# Summary.
A disadvantage is that the dataset included UFOs sightings only in the US and may not get attention from other countries.
One recommendation would be to utilize CSS and Bootstrap to further decorate the website.
